## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The project focuses on leveraging Clover's Android SDK to develop an intuitive mobile application aimed at facilitating the management of appointments for employees. It aims to provide a seamless user experience by allowing employees to efficiently create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) appointments.

Primarily designed for businesses such as barbershops or service centers, the app is intended to streamline appointment scheduling, enabling employees to easily manage their daily schedules. Additionally, the app may incorporate advanced functionalities, including integration with popular calendar services like Google Calendar and/or Outlook Calendar. This integration aims to synchronize appointments across platforms, providing users with convenient access to their schedules, thereby improving productivity and time management.
